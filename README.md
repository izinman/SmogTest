### Update February 2018: I will not be continuing work on this project.
Due to the fact that VBA is an awful programming language, and difficulties with compatibility with different Excel versions, I am officially abandoning this project. Work should *not* be put into continuing the project in its current state, since the convenience of working entirely within Excel is more than outweighed by the frustration of trying to work with a deprecated, buggy, poorly-designed language. The concept is solid, though, and it could certainly be useful to create something similar with a real programming language.

This is an Excel add-on written in Visual Basic for Applications. It is designed to intake data in a specific format to help with the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model for source attribution in air pollution research. It is intended to supplement the existing EPA-CMB software to aid in selecting candidate sources to be plugged into the CMB model. More specifically, it combines ambient data and source profiles in separate Excel files to quickly produce Excel plots with the source profiles superimposed over the ambient data. 

Current status: a non-functional proof-of-concept which can create an example plot with dummy data.
